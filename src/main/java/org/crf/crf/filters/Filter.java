/**
 * A filter determines whether it is known <B>a priori</B> that the feature value is zero
 * for a given input. "Input" is the sequence of tokens, the token-index, its tag, and the tag of the preceding token.
 * <P>
 * The CRF formula e^{weight-vector*feature-vector} might be quite expensive in run-time complexity notion. However,
 * in most cases most of the features return zero for the given input. Thus, there is no need to sum over all the features,
 * but only over those which <B>might</B> return a non-zero value.
 * <BR>
 * Concretely, Assume we have a {@link CrfFilteredFeature} and a {@link Filter}: if the filter {@link #equals(Object)
 * to {@link CrfFilteredFeature#getFilter()}, then the feature <B>might</B> return a non-zero value. Otherwise, it is
 * known for sure that it returns zero.
 * <P>
 * The usage of filters is to build a map from {@link Filter } to a <B>set of</B> {@link CrfFilteredFeature}s, and for each input
 * create filters and use them to retrieve the set of relevant features from the map.
